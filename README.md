## Introduction

A firewall stands as an essential guardian in the realm of network security—a sophisticated network security device that conscientiously monitors and exerts control over incoming and outgoing network traffic, grounded upon a bedrock of preconfigured security rules. It takes on the role of a sentinel, erecting an impenetrable barricade between realms of trust and the uncharted territories of untrusted networks. It strategically positions itself within the digital landscape, frequently securing the demarcation between LAN and WAN networks, enshrining the integrity and security of the network.
