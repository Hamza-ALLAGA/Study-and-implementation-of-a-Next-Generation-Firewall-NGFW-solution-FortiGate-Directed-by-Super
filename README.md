## Abstract

This repository documents the comprehensive study and practical implementation of a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) solution using FortiGate. The abstract outlines the process of researching, evaluating, and deploying the FortiGate NGFW to meet the specific security needs of an organization. The implementation involves meticulous configuration, performance testing, and seamless integration into the existing network infrastructure. This includes the establishment of access control policies, creation of security zones, and implementation of VPN connections. The abstract also emphasizes the necessity of continuous maintenance and monitoring to sustain the FortiGate NGFW's effectiveness in safeguarding the organization's network.

## Introduction

In the realm of network security, a firewall stands as a sentinel – a network security device that orchestrates the control of incoming and outgoing network traffic based on meticulously defined security rules. The mantle of responsibility it bears is that of a guardian, positioned as a stalwart sentinel between networks of trust and those untrusted. As a crucial cornerstone of network security, a firewall fortifies the safety of an organization's digital domains.

6. Bestow configuration upon the appliance, gifting it with network connections and an allocation of resources befitting its stature.

### Configuration of Management Ports

The bastion that is the FortiGate's management interface can be fortified through the incantations of the Command Line Interface (CLI):

```shell
config system interface
edit mgmt
set ip *management_IP_address* *subnet_mask*
set allowaccess https ssh ping http
end
