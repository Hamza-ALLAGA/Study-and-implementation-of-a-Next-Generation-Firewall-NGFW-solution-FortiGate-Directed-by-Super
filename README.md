# Study-and-implementation-of-a-Next-Generation-Firewall(NGFW) solution-FortiGate


# Abstract 


The abstract of the study and implementation of a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) solution using FortiGate would describe the process of researching and evaluating the features and capabilities of the FortiGate NGFW to determine its suitability for meeting the specific security needs of an organization. The implementation process would involve configuring and setting up the FortiGate NGFW, testing and evaluating its performance, and integrating it into the organization's existing network infrastructure. This may include implementing access control policies, creating security zones, and setting up VPN connections. The abstract would also mention the ongoing maintenance and monitoring necessary to ensure the continued effectiveness of the FortiGate NGFW in protecting the organization's network.
# Introduction 

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It serves as a barrier between a trusted and untrusted network and can be positioned between a LAN and WAN network as per specific requirements to ensure the security of the network.
